<< ATTACHMENT : <sample metadata file >>

I need Python code to generate a JSON file for testing some 
location data analysis code against.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. FILE SYNTAX/STRUCTURE: The structure and field names should 
follow the sample JSON file provided.

2. FILE LENGTH: The file should contain a total number of records, 
set from the command line (e.g. --records 100).

3. CONTENT/VALUE DISTRIBUTION: Across the whole file, I want 
command-line arguments to control how many random location entries 
to include (e.g. --random 35) and how many "Scotland" entries to 
include (e.g. --scotland 10). Scotland values should vary in casing 
and may have leading/trailing whitespace. These counts are totals 
for the entire file, not per record.

4: EMPTY VALUES: All other location entries should be treated as 
“blank,” using a mix of null, empty strings, or whitespace-only 
strings.

5. OUTPUT: The output should be a single JSON file, matching the 
sample’s structure, with the specified totals distributed across 
the records. Within each record, only the locations block matters. 
For brevity you can skip all other record blocks when generating 
the output. The file path is to be provided on the command line 
(e.g. --out .\out.json).
