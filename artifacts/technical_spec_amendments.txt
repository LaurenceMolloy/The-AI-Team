ADJUSTMENT #1:

Can you adjust the code to provide the user supplied path as a processed_folder 
field in the yaml file immediately above the file listings and then remove the 
path from all the filenames themselves (as they are no longer necessary)

ADJUSTMENT #2:

Can you now add a new block to the YAML that keeps count of how populated each 
file is in terms of location and provides a summary of how many files falls into 
each bucket as specified below. Please include the comments in the output yaml.
I believe you will need to use ruamel for that.

location_population_level_distribution:

  empty: <int>
  trace: <int>         # up to 5% populated
  low: <int>           # 5% < population level <= 25%
  medium: <int>        # 25% < population level <= 50%
  high: <int>          # 50% < population level < 100%
  full: <int>          # 100% populated

ADJUSTMENT #3:

Can you now add the same but for location="Scotland" prevalence.
Call this block scottish_location_distribution
